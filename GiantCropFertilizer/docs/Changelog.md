=============

TODO: Transpile DGA to support DGA crops tooo (https://github.com/spacechase0/StardewValleyMods/blob/e61398e83bffeaeba472cca6d57d8dd71a5acfa5/DynamicGameAssets/Game/CustomCrop.cs#L420)

#### Version 0.1.3

* Added Chinese translation, much thanks to [Becks723](https://github.com/Becks723)!
* Added a slight chance for the fertilizer to appear in big slimes in the dangerous skull caverns.
* Optionally allow giant crops on every map (note that More Giant Crops will also allow this, so the setting is not in GMCM if More Giant Crops is installed).
* Migrated to SMAPI 3.14.0
* Remove compat patches for Multifertilizer versions 1.0.6 and above as they are no longer necessary.

#### Version 0.1.2
Makes the chance of getting a giant crop configurable. Adds code to handle JA shuffling.

#### Version 0.1.1
Reduces excess logging. Adjusts compat patches for MoreFertilizer.

#### Version 0.1.0

Initial upload.
